-- We say that a variable x is boun the term λ x -> e and the the score of this binding is
-- term expression e

-- A variable x in a term e that does not appear in the scope of any abstraction λ x -> is
-- reffered to as free in e

-- for example x, y are bound and z is free in λ x -> λ y -> x y z

-- A λ calculus term thas no free variables is called closed
